By looking at the usage of carparks trends through historical data analysis, we can forecast the availability of carparks in the long-term. Developers can identify hotspots where there may often be high usage of car parks and thus an excellent location to build more lots or carparks to cater to the high demand. In contrast, this long-term analysis can also identify potential spots where space can be saved by reducing the number of lots or carparks that don't have high usage forecasted.\n",
