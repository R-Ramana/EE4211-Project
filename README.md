# EE4211-Project

A multi-pronged approach wherein we used data to assist 2 different stakeholders: vehicle drivers and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)/Land Transport Authority (LTA). Our approach allows us to analyse data for individual carparks and make predictions based on historical data.

For URA/LTA, carpark availability can be utilized to produce better urban planning proposals. While for vehicle drivers, our recommendation system targets users aiming to plan their trips early. Such users will be required to provide their destination and estimated time of arrival (in terms of hours from now capped at 24 hours) and our system will provide them with the best available parking option based on distance from their destination and parking availability.
