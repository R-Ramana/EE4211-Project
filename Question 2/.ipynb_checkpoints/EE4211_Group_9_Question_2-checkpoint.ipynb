    "This would help commuters easily identify available carparks they can use and easily plan their route and schedule ahead of time. At the same time, by being able to forecast availability of carparks, developers can identify hotspots where there may often be high usage of car parks and thus a good location to build more lots or carparks to cater to the high demand. In contrast, they can also identify potential spots where space which is a constraint in SG, can be saved by reducing the number of lots or carparks that don't have high usage forecasted. Event organisers can also plan their events around where there would be high percentage of free carparks through analysing this forecasting model."
